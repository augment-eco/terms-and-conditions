# Augment Theft Coverage

Please read this Disclosure to ensure your understanding of how “Augment Theft Coverage” with Theft and Loss works.

One (1) Augment Theft Coverage subscription covers one (1) e-scooter. If you want to cover for more than one e-scooter, you will need a separate Augment Theft Coverage subscription for each of them.

## In the event of a theft / loss of an e-scooter

If the scooter / battery is stolen, report the incident to the local police within 48 hours. Then report the incident to Augment as soon as possible via Augment's Live Chat. A copy of the police report will be requested.

Once you have reported the incident to Augment, you will be sent a replacement e-scooter / battery / e-scooter + battery. Augment replacement e-scooters may be refurbished and may have signs of use.

In the event of a theft / loss of the e-scooter, the main Augment service agreement will continue as before the theft / loss.
